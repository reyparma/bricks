General steps to create the starter app:

1. mkdir test_starter_app
2. cd test_starter_app
3. mason init
4. mason add starter_app --git-url https://github.com/reyparma/bricks --git-path starter_app
5. mason make starter_app --on-conflict overwrite

Check the reference at the bottom of this page for the Mason documentation.

# Build Tips

Make sure that your Auth0 settings for Allowed Callback and Logout URLs are in sync with the names used when you create the starter app.

1. WEB - No issues here
2. ANDROID - You may need to change the plugins section of the android/settings.gradle file depending on the version of Gradle or Kotlin installed on your system.  Here's mine:
```
plugins {
    id "dev.flutter.flutter-plugin-loader" version "1.0.0"
    id "com.android.application" version "7.3.0" apply false
    id "org.jetbrains.kotlin.android" version "1.9.0" apply false
}
```
  
3. IOS - Open Runner.xcworkspace in XCode and edit the team and bundle identifier before running the app.  Ensure the minimum version of IOS is 13.0 in the ios/Podfile.
